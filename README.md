# arduino_32u4_programmer
This program will allow you burn a firmware file (.HEX) onto an ATMega32u4 microcontroller if it has an arduino bootloader. 
Under the hood, AVRDUDE (program for downloading and uploading the on-chip memories of Microchipâ€™s AVR microcontrollers) is used invoked to perform the actual update.
In an effort to reduce the number of external dependencies, the following version of AVRDUDE is embedded inside this application:

# Usage
The graphical interface requires a few input parameters prior to programming
* Windows COM Port of the device (Dropdown menu, click Refresh "F5" to update the list).
* Path of the .hex firmware file (FilePicker Dialog)

If you have multiple COM ports in the list, you can identify the correct on using the following technique:
* Unplug the device from your computer
* Refresh and note which ports are available.
* Plug the device back into your computer
* Select the new COM port
